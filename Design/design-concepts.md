Design Concepts

My overall concept for the site is to create a really clean and modernly styled page. I personally always enjoy a really cleanly styled website with good color and strong lines. As for the page's theme, I'd like to play around with the juxataposition of the sun and the moon, along with dark vs. light colors in the background, images, and text. I think this will make for an enjoyable page asthetic, as well as enable naturally dividing sections for the information on the page. 

I hope to use a lot of the skills we have learned so far - borders, transitions, etc to make a really eye-catching page, while still ensuring that all of the information is displayed in a manner that works and is easy for the user to read. User-experience is key, and I want to create a page that provides a really interesting perspective. I will focus on laying out the information and images in a manner that are not distracting. I will also utilize different means of grouping (colors, borders, text position) so that each section is clearly defined. While it is my hope to create a really visually-stricking page, I will not do so at the sacrifice of the user's expeirience with pages's information. I'll focus on making the structure and styling compliment each other nicely.

My favorite pages that have inspired some of my own ideas are:
